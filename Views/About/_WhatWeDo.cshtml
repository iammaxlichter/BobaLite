                    It all started with a group of college students, tired of sugary drinks and expensive boba runs.
                    Armed with creativity, a love for tea, and a tight budget, we set out to rethink what boba could be.
                    <strong>What began in a cramped apartment kitchen turned into a low-calorie boba revolution.</strong>

                    Today, BobaLite crafts refreshing, guilt-free boba teas you can enjoy anywhere â€” no straw, no shop
                    needed. We use real brewed tea, natural ingredients, and just the right amount of sweetness to
                    deliver a can packed with flavor, not calories. From our first prototype to our latest release,
                    we're driven by one goal: to make boba better, lighter, and more fun for everyone.
